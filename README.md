# 6502 Emulator Summary
I have written this emulator as a way of learning some basic emulation practice with the hopes of eventually writing an emulator for a more complicated processor.

See my [Reference Manual](/Cubas%20Reference%20Manual.md) for all my collected knowledge on the processor.

The beginnings of this emulator was written using the tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJgsuQoy9bc)
